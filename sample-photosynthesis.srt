00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,600
This process occurs primarily in the chloroplasts of plant cells.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,200
Chlorophyll, the green pigment in chloroplasts, absorbs light energy.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,800
The process can be divided into two main stages: light-dependent reactions

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,400
and light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,000
During light-dependent reactions, water molecules are split,

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,600
releasing oxygen as a byproduct and generating ATP and NADPH.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,200
These energy carriers are then used in the Calvin cycle

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,800
to fix carbon dioxide into glucose and other organic compounds.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,400
The overall equation for photosynthesis is:

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,000
six carbon dioxide plus six water plus light energy

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,600
yields one glucose molecule plus six oxygen molecules.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,200
Photosynthesis is crucial for life on Earth as it produces

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,800
the oxygen we breathe and forms the base of most food chains.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,400
Different wavelengths of light are absorbed differently by chlorophyll.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,000
Red and blue light are absorbed most efficiently,

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,600
while green light is reflected, which is why plants appear green.

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,200
Environmental factors like light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration,

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,800
and temperature can affect the rate of photosynthesis.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,400
Plants have evolved various adaptations to optimize photosynthesis,

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,000
such as C4 and CAM pathways for plants in hot, dry climates.
