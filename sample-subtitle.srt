00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Welcome to this introduction to quantum computing.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,200
Quantum computers use principles of quantum mechanics

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,800
to process information in fundamentally different ways than classical computers.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,300
The basic unit of quantum information is called a qubit.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,200
Unlike classical bits which can only be zero or one,

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,800
qubits can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,500
This property allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,100
exponentially faster than classical computers.

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,800
Another key principle is quantum entanglement,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,500
where qubits become correlated in ways that have no classical equivalent.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,200
Quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,900
and Grover's algorithm for searching databases demonstrate

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,600
the potential power of quantum computing.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,300
However, quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,800
and environmental interference, a problem called decoherence.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Building practical quantum computers requires maintaining

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,200
extremely cold temperatures near absolute zero.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,900
Current applications include cryptography, drug discovery,

19
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,600
optimization problems, and materials science.
